          <span class="style1"><img src="images/zhaopian0.jpg" width="197" height="123" align="left">The academic exchanges between NLSSMS and institutions of higher learning in foreign countries have beenexpanding extensively. The lab have received 165 foreign visitors and sent 180 faculty and students abroad to do research and to be trained. Joint research programs and cooperations have been initiated with weli- known scientists and research institutions in the world. The lab has also approved 22 international opening projects to do collaboration in its actlve fields.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          The scientific achievement of the lab is quite outstanding. Since the beginning of its establishment in 1984, the lab has won 4 national prizes, 49 prizes at ministerial and provincial level. More than 2300 papers have been published in major international and domestic, journals and 48 monographs and books have been published as well. It should be noted that the annual output of papers published in 6 top international journals, (Nature, Science, PRL, PR, APL, and JAP) has been nearly quadrupled in 6 years, from 15 in 1991 to 57 in 1997. It is a clear indication of the rise of research level of the lab. It achieved preeminence in several research directions, i. e., periodically and quasiperiodically modulated ferroelectrics for nonlinear optics a<img src="images/publication.JPG" width="216" height="142" align="right">nd acoustics, quasiperiodic metallic superlattices, experimental studies on domain structure related to phase transitions, lattice instabilities of high Tc superconductors, kinetics of crystal growth, the nanostructured magnetic materials and nanostructured Si -based materials.<br>
          <br>
    The lab is always classed among the highest rank in every assessment of the State key labs undertaken by governmentagencies. It was mentioned by the worldfamous scientific journal &quot;Nature&quot; as an institution in Asia(outside Japan) withresearch standard approaching world - class [ Nature, 389 (1997) 113 ].</span></p>
