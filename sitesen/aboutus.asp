	>The National Labaratory of Solid State Mierostructures(NLSSMS)of Nanjing University is located in the center of the historic city Nanjing. As one of the major labs approved and funded by the National Planning Commission of China in 1984, it was established ratified in 1987.NI,SSMS is divided into four divisions: observation of microstructures, spectroscopy and physical properties fabrication, and tile study of new materials and condensed matter theory. They compose 17 research groups.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        NLSSMS covers researches on distribution, interaction, fabrication and transformation of microstruetures at different levels. Special attention is paid to the relationship between the microstructures and the physical properties. With the help of the experimental methods of state- of-art, various kinds of microstructured materials are designed and fabricated. The physical process and effects therein are investigated. New functional materials with expected microstructures and performance are designed and developed via various modern techniques.<br>
        <br>
        The mission of NLSSMS is to develop experimental techniques and methods of fabrication, observation and measurement of the microstructured materials, to study physics of defects and phase transition, and to establish theoretical methods and computing techniques of solid state microstructures. By revealing the links between microstructures of the materials and physical properties, it is expected to control the solid state microstr<img src="images/112.jpg" width="150" height="160" align="right">uctures , which can be functioned in their applications. At present the materials under investigation in NLSSMS include solid thin films, muhilayered films and nanosized and cluster materials, dielectric superlattice and semiconductor superlattiee, high Tc superconductors, liquid crystals, polymers, and colloids , etc.<br>
        <br>
        Profs. Duan Feng and Nai - ben Ming, members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, are the Director of the Academic Committee and the Director of NLSSMS respectively. They are also chief scientists of the national &quot;climbing projects&quot; of &quot;Nanomaterials Science&quot; and&quot;Opto- electric Functional Materials&quot; There are 187 active research projects in NLSSMS, which belong to national &quot;climbing projects&quot;, &quot;863 projects&quot;, NSF projects.</span></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1 style2"><span class="style11">The academic exchanges between NLSSMS and institutions of higher learning in foreign countries have beenexpanding extensively. The lab have received 165 foreign visitors and sent 180 faculty and students abroad to do research and to be trained. Joint research programs and cooperations have been initiated with weli- known scientists and research institutions in the world. The lab has also approved 22 international opening projects to do collaboration in its actlve fields.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <img src="images/zhaipian9.jpg" width="150" height="150" align="left">The scientific achievement of the lab is quite outstanding. Since the beginning of its establishment in 1984, the lab has won 4 national prizes, 49 prizes at ministerial and provincial level. More than 2300 papers have been published in major international and domestic, journals and 48 monographs and books have been published as well. It should be noted that the annual output of papers published in 6 top international journals, (Nature, Science, PRL, PR, APL, and JAP) has been nearly quadrupled in 6 years, from 15 in 1991 to 57 in 1997. It is a clear indication of the rise of research level of the lab. It achieved preeminence in several research directions, i. e., periodically and quasiperiodically modulated ferroelectrics for nonlinear optics and acoustics, quasiperiodic metallic superlattices, experimental studies on domain structure related to phase transitions, lattice instabilities of high Tc superconductors, kinetics of crystal growth, the nanostructured magnetic materials and nanostructured Si -based materials.<br>
<br>
The lab is always classed among the highest rank in every assessment of the State key labs undertaken by governmentagencies. It was mentioned by the worldfamous scientific journal &quot;Nature&quot; as an institution in Asia(outside Japan) withresearch standard approaching world - class [ Nature, 389 (1997) 113 ].</span></p>
